      no choice but to agree. '
    - 'You were sick for a whole year, during which time your soul traveled upstream
      to the Nine Heavens and downstream to the underworld, and you even became one
      with the highest heaven in the universe. When you woke up, you were a different
      person. '

      notice you in the dark, so you dodged a bullet. '
    goodResultList:

    goodResultList:
    - 'You''re such a powerhouse, you didn''t keep your girlfriend, but you kept
